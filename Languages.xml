      A shell script / shell command to be executed after the sugar is acquired,

      This will be executed with the downloaded and uncompressed directory as 
      the working directory. No other environment is guaranteed, so be as explicit 
      as possible. This is primarily intended for Cocoa sugars to compile themselves 
      before installation.
      
      This tag may also appear more than once, though that should be avoided. Order 
      of execution is not guaranteed.
